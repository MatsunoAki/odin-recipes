            <li>1/2 lb thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, cut and separated into 1/2 inch wedges</li>
            <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dashi</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Toppings: Beni shouga, shichimi, chopped green onion</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the eggs: Place the eggs in a pot and pour enough boiling water on top of them to submerge the eggs completely. Cover with the lid, and let rest for 8-10 minutes, depending on the size of your eggs. Remove eggs from the hot water and place in ice water to cool. Once cool (2-3 minutes), crack the eggs gently into two small bowls. The white of the egg should be slightly runny and loose, and the yolk should still be soft. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pot, bring water to a boil, and then turn off the heat. Add the sliced beef and parboil, stirring to loosen the meat, until just cooked and its red color has disappeared, about 1-2 minutes. Immediately remove beef from the pot, drain well, and set aside. Do not overcook.</li>
        <li>Place soy sauce, sake, sugar, and mirin in a pan set on medium heat. When the mixture begins to bubble, add the beef and toss to coat the meat with the sauce evenly. Before the sauce evaporates, turn off the heat, remove the beef from the pan, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add water, dashi, and ginger to the remaining sauce in the pan. Bring it up to heat, and add in the onions once it begins to bubble. Cover with a lid, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to low, give the onions a stir, and then cook until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the beef back into the pan to reheat.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with rice. Spoon the beef and onions with sauce on top of the rice. Garnish with a sprinkle of green onions, a small mound of beni shouga, and shichimi togarashi. Gently slide the egg from its bowl and place on top of the beef.</li>
    </ol>
