    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>For the chicken meatballs:</h4>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your ingredients in the following manner, and set them aside until ready to cook:</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Napa cabbage: Separate the leaves, wash in cold water, and slice crosswise into 1 inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>Chrysanthemum greens (or any leafy greens): Wash and cut into 2 - 3 inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>Green onions: Wash and slice the white and green parts into 1 inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>Shiitake mushrooms: Wipe clean with a damp paper towel. Cut off the tough or woody ends of the stems, if necessary. Cut an X pattern at the center of the mushroom cap, if desired (this step is pure aesthetic). If using a portobello mushroom, cut into 1/4 inch slices.</li>
                    <li>Enoki mushrooms: Briefly rinse in cold water. Cut off the dried bottom portion and separate mushrooms into several small clumps.</li>
                    <li>Tofu: Drain of any liquid and cut into 1 inch cubes.</li>
                    <li>Carrots: Peel and cut crosswise into 1/8 inch slices.</li>
                    <li>Aburaage: Bring a pot of water to a boil. Submerge aburaage and boil for 30 - 60 seconds to remove some of the oil. Remove from the water and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze the remaining water from the aburaage using your hands. Cut into 1/4 inch slices.</li>
                    <li>Fish: Scale, rinse, and remove any bones. Cut into 1.5 - 2 inch pieces. Sprinkle with sake and let sit for 1 - 2 minutes to remove some of the fishy smell. Blot dry using a paper towel.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Mix together all the soup base ingredients in a clay nabe pot, and set on medium high heat until simmering. Add a portion of the chicken meatballs, cabbage, green onions, aburaage, carrots, and tofu to the pot, keeping the items separated from each other and grouped together with their respective types.</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Cover, return pot to a simmer, and cook for about 5 minutes, turning the ingredients every so often to ensure the uppermost items are cooked evenly.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Add a portion of the leafy greens, mushrooms, and fish, and continue cooking until the chicken meatballs and fish are cooked through and the napa cabbage is soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve by removing desired items from the pot and placing into a small bowl. Turn down the heat to low to prevent overcooking the items remaining in the pot.</li>
            <li>When the items in the pot have been removed, turn the heat back to medium high and add another serving of vegetables and meat. Place the ingredients in groups in the broth and simmer as before until cooked through.</li>
            <li>At the end of the meal, add udon to the empty pot and cooking the noodles as per the instructions on the package. Serve udon with a bit of the leftover broth.</li>
        </ol>
